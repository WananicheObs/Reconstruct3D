the process is divided into multiple important steps:
- **Edge detection** using [insert algorithm name here]

## Requirements
- **git**
- **CMake 3.20** or higher
- **C/C++20** compatible compiler
- **Vulkan SDK** (for image analysis and rendering)

## How to use
1. use **git clone https://github.com/WananicheObs/Reconstruct3D.git**
2. Update the **Include.cmake** paths if necesary
3. Build the project using **CMake** and **C/C++20**
